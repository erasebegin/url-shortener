## URL Shortener

![project screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/g358DZ7/image.png)

A URL shortener that takes any URL and generates a shortened URL consisting of either a user-defined string or a randomly generated series of alphanumeric characters.

## Why though?

To improve my understanding of the Firebase API

## Known Issues

Does not currently correctly detect duplicate URL aliases so a duplicate will always return the last URL that was assigned to that alias
